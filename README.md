### Description

The idea of this project was to scrape data from MyAnimeList.net to then perform some interesting statistical analyses and/or make a recommender algorithm based on the data.
MyAnimeList is especially suitable for this as many of the users make an active list of the series they watched along with the ratings of each.

### Problem

Unfortunately, I never got past the scraping phase of this project, due to not being able to get sufficient amount of data.
There is a "Users" page that I started scraping from, however I later learnt, that it termines at 100th page (covering only a small minority of millions of users).
I haven't been able to find a better way to scrape the users yet, so the project is indefinitely on hold.
One idea is to scrape based on ID, but I am not sure if the user IDs really are sequential (I've seen some users with an ID value of 12e6 or higher, which would be sloooow...).
